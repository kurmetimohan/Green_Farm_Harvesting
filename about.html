        <h3>History Greenform pvt.ltd</h3>
        <p>GreenForm Pvt Ltd is an agriculture-focused company that connects farmers directly with customers,  ensuring fresh produce and efficient transportation. Here’s a brief overview of its services:</p>
        <p>Kurmeti Mohan, the founder of a company named "Green Form" , who has a background in agriculture and a Master's in Computer Science from Osmania University, with an intent to serve farmers and customers since 2025 MAY 19.<br>
         However, there is no publicly available information in the provided references or my knowledge base that directly confirms the existence of a company called "Green Form" or details about Kurmeti Mohan as its founder. 
         The year 2025 is also the current year, so it’s unclear if this refers to a newly established venture or a future projection.Since I cannot find specific details about Kurmeti Mohan or "Green Form," I’ll address your
          request for the "current form" by interpreting it as a request for the current status or context of such a company or individual, based on the details you provided.</p>
